# L Train Bingo

This app is designed as create-your-own bingo card and share/play with friends across the internet. It's designed with a Ruby on Rails API and a React.js single-page web app for quick and seemless user interaction. Rather than just checking off a square, users can upload media (currently just photos) to prove that they've earned their bingo square.

This application is still under construction and more extensive documentation is coming.
